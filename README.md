# EC4044 Applied Economic Analysis

> The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. 

--Albert Einstein

> Routine, in an intelligent man, is a sign of ambition. 

â€”WH Auden


# Welcome to this module

* This is a *brand new* module, EC4044. 
* This is the first time it has been taught. So please, bear with me. 
* Slides will be added to this master version as I get the chance to build them out. 
* In addition to being a pedagogical experiment, this is also technical experiment. 
* We'll be using some open-source tools, your feedback will be crucial as we develop the material.  

# Learning outcomes for this module

0. Understand principles of data science;
1. Understand where economic data come from;
2. Understand the *politics* of economic data collection and dissemination;
3. Estimate simple economic models
4. Understand the merits of qualitative as well as quantitative economic analysis. Economics is not all ones and zeroes. You do have to talk to real people from time to time. 

# How you'll learn

0. Hands-on, with your laptops or tablets in class. Laptops are better, but whatever works for you. 
1. The idea is to make this module, as far as possible, one 36 hour-long lab. 
2. You'll become familiar with a cutting edge statistical language and gain the ability to produce really nice reports, slides, and data analysis using this software. You'll also learn how to interview individuals and groups. 
3. Importantly, your work will be open for everyone to view. You'll gain an appreciation of the kind of work that gets social scientists interested in things. 

# Key Resources

- David Freedman, [*Statistical Models, Theory and Practice*](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Models-Practice-David-Freedman/dp/0521743850), Cambridge University Press, 2009. This is the best book on statistics I have ever read. 
- Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), O'Reilly, 2016.
- Gary Koop, *Analysis of Economic Data*, Wiley, 2013. This book is a classic and fun to read. 
- *Lots* of online resources with R, especially [Datacamp](http://www.datacamp.com)

# Assessment

- 2 Datacamp courses, introducing you to R, worth 5% and intermediate programming in R, worth 10%. These are both due by the end of week 4. 
- 1 optional Datacamp course, which you choose, worth 10%. Peruse the course catalogue and let us know which one you want. Guide your own learning. 
- 1 end of term project, due week 13. Details of this will be given in the tutorials, it is worth 75-85%. 
- The objective is not to over-assess you. Rather, there are some basics you need to know to progress in this module, and then to let you play with the data and the tools we give you. The more you use it, the better you'll be at it.
